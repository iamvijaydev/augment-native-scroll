# Augment Native Scroll
Experiments with custom wrappers over native scroll to achieve higher order functions

### Objective
Primary objective is to have multiple (related) scrollable areas, scroll as one, when anyone of them is scrolled. The demo is step up to test them on UIWebView (iOS) and determine the best way we can achieve the desired results. There are three different implemented flavors of native scrolls listed below:

### Synchronous Scroll Swipe
_Augmenting default scroll and Mimic tap-swipe on non-touch devices_

This flavor detects touch support and provides synchronous scroll on both touch and no-touch devices. Additionally on non-touch devices it also provided swipe to scroll.

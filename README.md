# Augment Native Scroll
Experiments with custom wrappers over native scroll for higher functions

The aim of this project is to experiment with custom wrappers over native scroll to achieve higher functionality. The prime feature is about synchronous scroll, where multiple scrollable areas, scroll as one when anyone of them is scrolled. The demos are step to test them on UIWebView (iOS) and determine the best way we can achieve the desired result.

## Synchronous Scroll
Related scrollable areas scroll as one when anyone of them is scrolled via mouse or keyboard. This is primarily focused for non-touch devices

## Swipe to Scroll
Related scrollable areas can be scrolled via swipe or on non-touch devices mimicking the same via mouse. This is primarily focused for bring touch like features to non-touch devices

## Both
Both the scrolling feature working together smoothly
